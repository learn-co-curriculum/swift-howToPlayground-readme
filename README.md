## Questions
 
* Included in the Repo should already be a Playground file.
* This is it how it should end up looking:

* If Render Documentation is checked, un-check it to be able to write your questions using Markdown.
* When Render Documentation is un-checked, you should see the following in the left pane now:

* This is exactly how you should format all your questions you would like to ask the student. To view your questions where the Markdown is being rendered, open back up that right pane (Hide or show the Utilities) and check off the Render Documentation box.


## Solution

* The 'main' file is where you write your questions in the format I outlined above.
* The 'solution" file is where you include your solutions to the questions.
* With the Render Documentation box checked off, this solution file should look like this:

* With the Render Documentation box un-checked, it should look like this:
